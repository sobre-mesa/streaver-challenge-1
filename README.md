Streaver Code Challenge

The application we are trying to build allows users to list posts from an API and allows the users to filter the posts by the userId of whoever wrote the post. The users of the application you are building usually travel a lot and are in places with bad or unstable internet connections and because of that we want to add some features that allow users to have a better experience.
